# redesign2
My teammate and I were tasked with finding and redesigning a graphic for our statistics colloquium class.

This is the original graphic that we found in an online article from the November 2014 issue of Discover Magazine.

This is our redesigned graphic:

We accomplished this using the Bokeh plotting library and a tiny bit of Microsoft PowerPoint (for the data table).
